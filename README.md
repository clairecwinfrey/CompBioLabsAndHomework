### README file for CompBioLabsAndHomework
#### EBIO 4420/5420, Spring 2021
The subdirectories contained in this repo are for submitting the labs and homework for EBIO 4420/5420 to GitHub. 
* Instructions for completing each lab are found on instructor Dr. Sam Flaxman's GitHub page for the class [here](https://github.com/flaxmans/CompBio_on_git)
* Subdirectories for this repo are arranged by lab (which are ordered by week in the class).
* Lab 06 is not in the repo because Lab 05 spanned two weeks of class. 
* Code is written in bash and in R.
* Finally, here is a picture of a cat coding, which I think exemplifies the vibes for this class:
